# Current Development Plan and Error Resolution

This document summarizes the current state of the project, the remaining errors, and the plan to resolve them. This is to ensure continuity and clarity, especially after a restart of the AI agent.

## Last Known State

*   **Feature in Progress:** Identity Verification for Job Seekers (Jober) and Employers.
*   **Phase 1 (Jober - Document Upload & PIN Creation):** Completed.
    *   Database attributes added to `user_profiles` (`idCardUrl`, `selfieWithIdUrl`, `verificationStatus`, `verificationPinHash`).
    *   `edit_profile_page.dart` modified for Jober to upload documents and set PIN.
    *   `crypto` package integrated for PIN hashing.
    *   `FileUploadService` adapted to use `company_logos` bucket for verification documents (due to Appwrite free tier limitations).
*   **Phase 2 (Employer - Verification Request & Viewing):** In progress.
    *   `lib/services/chat_service.dart` modified to handle new message types and include chat partner details.
    *   `chat_room_page.dart` modified to add "View Verification" button, dialogs for PIN entry and document viewing, and updated message bubbles.

## Remaining Compilation Errors (from last `flutter run -d chrome` output)

The application failed to compile with several errors, primarily due to structural issues in `lib/services/chat_service.dart` and cascading effects.

1.  **`lib/services/chat_service.dart:1043:7: Error: 'chatServiceProvider' is already declared in this scope.`**
    *   **Cause:** `chatServiceProvider` is declared twice in `lib/services/chat_service.dart`. This happened because the previous `replace` operation to move `ChatRoomState`, `ChatRoomService`, and `chatRoomServiceProvider` (which implicitly included `chatServiceProvider` in the `old_string`) resulted in `chatServiceProvider` being duplicated.
    *   **Fix:** Remove the duplicated `chatServiceProvider` declaration.

2.  **`lib/services/chat_service.dart:172:22: Error: Type 'appwrite_models.RealtimeMessage' not found.` (and similar for line 771)**
    *   **Cause:** `StreamSubscription<appwrite_models.RealtimeMessage>` is used in `ChatService` and `ChatRoomService` without `appwrite_models` being correctly recognized in that context. This is a persistent issue, likely due to the structural problems.
    *   **Fix:** Ensure `import 'package:appwrite/models.dart' as appwrite_models;` is correctly placed and recognized. This might resolve once the structural issues are fixed.

3.  **`lib/features/chat/chat_room_page.dart` errors (multiple): `Error: The method 'chatRoomServiceProvider' isn't defined for the class '_ChatRoomPageState'.`**
    *   **Cause:** `chat_room_page.dart` cannot find `chatRoomServiceProvider`. This is likely because `chatRoomServiceProvider` is not correctly defined as a top-level provider in `chat_service.dart` (due to the duplication/structural issues).
    *   **Fix:** This should resolve once `chat_service.dart` is structurally correct and `chatRoomServiceProvider` is properly defined as a top-level provider.

4.  **`lib/services/chat_service.dart:437:37: Error: Undefined name 'ID'.` (and similar for lines 466, 948)**
    *   **Cause:** `appwrite_models.ID.unique()` is not correctly referencing `ID`.
    *   **Fix:** Ensure `import 'package:appwrite/appwrite.dart' as appwrite;` is present and `appwrite_models.ID.unique()` is used where `ID.unique()` was intended. (This was previously fixed, but seems to have reappeared due to the file's state).

## Plan to Resolve Errors

The primary goal is to correct the structural issues in `lib/services/chat_service.dart` and then address cascading errors.

1.  **Correct `lib/services/chat_service.dart`:**
    *   **Action:** I will provide a complete, corrected version of `lib/services/chat_service.dart`. This will ensure:
        *   `ChatService` class and its `chatServiceProvider` are correctly defined.
        *   `ChatRoomState` class is correctly defined as a top-level class.
        *   `ChatRoomService` class and its `chatRoomServiceProvider` are correctly defined as top-level classes.
        *   All necessary imports (`dart:async`, `dart:convert`, `package:crypto/crypto.dart`, `package:appwrite/appwrite.dart`, `package:appwrite/models.dart` as `appwrite_models`) are present and correctly placed.
        *   Correct usage of `appwrite_models.ID.unique()` where `ID.unique()` was previously used.
        *   Correct `StreamSubscription` types are used.
        *   There are no duplicated `chatServiceProvider` or `chatRoomServiceProvider` declarations.

2.  **Verify `lib/features/chat/chat_list_page.dart`:**
    *   **Action:** After `chat_service.dart` is fixed, I will verify that `import 'package:mvp_package_ui/services/chat_service.dart';` is present.

3.  **Verify `lib/features/chat/chat_room_page.dart`:**
    *   **Action:** After `chat_service.dart` is fixed, I will verify that `import 'package:mvp_package_ui/services/chat_service.dart';` is present and `chatRoomServiceProvider` is correctly referenced.

4.  **Verify `lib/services/auth_service.dart`:**
    *   **Action:** After `chat_service.dart` is fixed, I will verify that `import 'package:mvp_package_ui/services/chat_service.dart';` is present.

This systematic approach should resolve all compilation errors.
